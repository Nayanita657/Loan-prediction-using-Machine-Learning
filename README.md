Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties.

In this project we have make use of pandas, matplotlib, & seaborn libraries from python to extract insights from the data and xgboost, & scikit-learn libraries for machine learning.

Secondly, we learn how to hypertune the parameters using grid search cross validation for the xgboost machine learning model.
to predict whether the loan applicant can replay the loan or not using voting ensembling techniques of combining the predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms.
